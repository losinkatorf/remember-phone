# Implementation Plan: Remember the Number

1.  **Setup:** Create the basic `index.html`, `style.css`, and JavaScript files (`data.js`, `logic.js`, `ui.js`).
2.  **HTML Structure:** Build the main HTML layout in `index.html` with sections for the main screen (phone list), the self-test screen, and the statistics page.
3.  **Styling:** In `style.css`, define styles for a clean, readable interface with large fonts and controls. I'll include a basic CSS framework and implement togglable light and dark themes.
4.  **Data Handling (`data.js`):** Implement functions to manage the phone list using the browser's `localStorage`. This will include functions to add, edit, delete, and retrieve phone numbers.
5.  **Main Screen (`ui.js`, `logic.js`):**
    *   Create the UI for adding, editing, and displaying the list of phone numbers.
    *   Write the logic to connect the UI to the data functions, making the CRUD operations work.
6.  **Self-Test Screen (`ui.js`, `logic.js`):**
    *   Design the UI for the self-test, showing a description and an input for the phone number.
    *   Implement the self-test logic: randomly select a phone, check the user's input, and provide feedback on correctness, highlighting any wrong digits.
7.  **Statistics Page (`ui.js`, `logic.js`):**
    *   Develop the UI to display a history of test attempts.
    *   Write the logic to save test results and display them in descending order by date.
8.  **Export/Import (`logic.js`):** Add buttons and logic to export the entire dataset (phones and stats) to a JSON file and import it back.
